== Open Questions

* Hierarchical packages?  E.g. should things defined on the `com.acme` package apply to things in the `com.acme.model` package?  Should `PackageDetails` have reference to its "parent" `PackageDetails`?
* Allow mapped-superclass in dynamic models?
* Support for `@Comment`


== XML Annotations

List of annotations I've come across as needing, mainly for dynamic models, which do not make general sense -

* `@Abstract`
* `@Extends`
* `@CollectionClassification`
* `@Target`[1]


[1] org.hibernate.annotations.Target does exist, but is deprecated.  Can either repurpose that one or create a new one along with these others.
